# Bio-inspired-Algorithms

I developed these algorithms for my sole purpose only, during undergraduation, so there was no intention be made for the Github community at that time. So, my progamming skills was not so that good back then.

- Particle Swarm Optmization (PSO).
- Continuous Bee Colony Optimization.
- Combinatorial Bee Colony Optimization.
- Discrete Bee Colony Optimization.
- Genetic Algorithm.
- Combinatorial Genetic Algorithm.
