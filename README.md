# Bio-inspired-Algorithms

I developed these algorithms for my sole purpose only, during graduation, so there was no intention be made for the Github community at that time.

- Particle Swarm Optmization (PSO).
- Continuous Bee Colony Optimization.
- Combinatorial Bee Colony Optimization.
- Discrete Bee Colony Optimization.
- Genetic Algorithm.
- Combinatorial Genetic Algorithm.
